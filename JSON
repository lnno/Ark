Rules
Stealing - Do not take items, resources, or creatures that belong to other players without their permission.

Griefing - Refrain from participating in actions that are intended to disrupt the gameplay or progress of other players, such as purposely leading hostile creatures to someone else's base or causing damage to their bases/dinos.

Blocking Resources - Avoid constructing barriers/structures that impede access to vital resources such as metal, crystal, and obsidian, as these materials are crucial for all players' progression and gameplay.

Blocking Spawns - Refrain from obstructing or constructing in close proximity to spawn points, as doing so can hinder new players from entering the game and lead to a frustrating initial experience for them.

Blocking Obelisks or Loot Drops - Avoid building structures in the vicinity of or directly over obelisks or loot drop sites, as these locations play a critical role in character and item transfers between servers.

PSA - If this menu does not close for you, press the Windows key on your keyboard and you'll be able to click the X to close the menu. This is going to be fixed in an upcoming update, I will leave this here until then.
