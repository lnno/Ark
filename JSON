                    Rules:
                    Building - We currently do not have rules in place for the size of player bases, but please be respectful. Our
                    server is very active and therefore means there aren't a lot of places to build. Please be mindful when 
                    building your base so new players have a spot to build. If we get complaints of render/lag issues, we will
                    ask you to down-size and/or move locations.
                    ───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
                    Stealing - Do not take items, resources, or creatures that belong to other players without their permission.
                    ──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
                    Stucture Spamming - Do NOT structure spam. If we find any structure spam(pillars, foundations, beds, etc), you will be warned
                    and if you continue to spam structures especially to stop spawns, you will be structure wiped.
                    ──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
                    Griefing - Refrain from participating in actions that are intended to disrupt the gameplay or progress of other players, 
                    such as purposely leading hostile creatures to someone else's base or causing damage to their bases/dinos.
                    ──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
                    Blocking Areas - Ensure an unobstructed environment by refraining from building structures near obelisks, loot drops, 
                    spawn points, and essential resource locations to facilitate smooth character transfers, new player entry, and equitable 
                    access to vital materials for progression. This includes oil, crystal, oil, odsidian, polymer and beaver dam locations.
                    ───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
                    Primal Items - Do NOT trade Primal Chaos progression items; this includes hide, blood, and especially kibble to players that have not
                    reached the specific tier of items they are asking for. Do your due diligence.
